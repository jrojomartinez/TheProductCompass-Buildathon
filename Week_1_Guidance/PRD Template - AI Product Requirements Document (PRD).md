* \[Metric 2, e.g., Y% of tasks automated\]  
* \[Metric 3, e.g., Z key outcomes achieved\]

# 2\. Market Opportunity

**Purpose**: Briefly summarize the initiative and success criteria for those who won’t read the entire document.

**Key Questions**:

* Is this the right market growth stage (e.g., emerging, maturing, declining)?  
* What is the market’s current growth rate (e.g., CAGR), and what data supports this?  
* What’s the potential for this opportunity in the future? Can it create enough business value?

**Example**:

Market \[X\] has shown a consistent growth rate of \[Y% CAGR\] due to \[drivers, e.g., regulatory changes, customer adoption\]. Currently, it’s at an \[stage, e.g., early growth\] stage (\[Z% market penetration\]), providing ample room for capturing substantial value. TAM projected at \[$amount\] by \[year\].

# 3\. Strategic Alignment

**Purpose**: Articulate how your product or feature aligns with your vision, strategy, and objectives.

**Key Questions**:

* Does this align with our company’s vision and long-term strategy?  
* How does this support our company objectives?  
* Does this play to our strengths and competencies?

**Example**:

\[Product/feature\] aligns with our company’s focus on \[sector/strategy\]. It directly supports our \[short/mid/long\]-term objective of \[objective, e.g., increasing adoption by X%\] by \[how it achieves this\].

# 4\. Customer & User Needs

**Purpose**: Prioritize solving the highest-value user problems clearly and precisely.

**Key Questions**:

* What are the key market segments and user personas?  
* What are their primary jobs-to-be-done and pain points?  
* Are there any constraints (e.g., geographic, language, regulatory)?  
* Which user problems, if solved, would generate the most frequent, severe, and widely experienced value?

**Example**:

Users in \[segment/persona\] spend \[time\] daily on \[task\], resulting in \[pain point, e.g., frequent errors\]. \[X%\] of users report this as their top pain (source: \[survey/analytics\], n=\[sample size\], \[importance vs. satisfaction metric\]). Constraints: \[list, e.g., geographic, regulatory\].

# 5\. Value Proposition & Messaging

**Purpose**: Communicate the unique value proposition clearly and compellingly.

**Key Questions**:

* Which problems for each market segment do we address?  
* What are the key capabilities and features (high-level) that solve those problems?  
* What are the benefits and customer outcomes?  
* How is this different from what others offer?  
* How can we clearly and compellingly communicate our product’s unique value to resonate with each segment?

**Example**:

\[Product/feature\] reduces \[problem\] by \[X%\], saving \[time/resource\], addressing \[pain point\] with \[key capability\]. Unlike \[competitor/alternative\], we offer \[differentiation\]. Messaging: “\[Short, compelling statement tailored to segment\].”

# 6\. Competitive Advantage

**Purpose**: Clarify your product’s defensibility and ability to sustain competitive advantage.

**Key Questions**:

* What makes us think competitors can’t/won’t copy our strategy?  
* How defensible and durable is our advantage in the long-term?

**Example**:

\[Product/feature\] leverages our \[unique asset, e.g., proprietary data, integrations\], giving us a \[timeframe\] competitive lead. Unlike \[competitor approach\], our \[specific advantage\] is hard to replicate due to \[reason\].

# 7\. Product Scope and Use Cases

**Purpose**: Define the key capabilities and features with tasks our product (or feature set) must perform exceptionally well.

**Key Questions**:

* What are the key capabilities and features?  
* Can we link designs or prototypes for better alignment?  
* What are the desired customer outcomes?  
* What are the high-risk assumptions? How can we test them with minimal effort?

**Example**:

\[Product/feature\] must \[key capability, e.g., generate accurate responses to X\]. Design: \[link to prototype\]. Outcome: \[measurable goal, e.g., X% satisfaction\]. High-risk assumption: \[assumption\]; Test: \[method, e.g., usability testing\].

# 8\. Non-Functional Requirements

## 8.1 General Requirements

**Purpose**: Define the essential system attributes (e.g., performance, scalability, security) that ensure the product operates reliably under expected conditions.

**Key Questions**:

* What technical, performance, scalability, security, and reliability attributes must our product achieve to deliver and sustain its intended value?  
* What are the peak load and user volume expectations?

**Example**:

\[Product/feature\] must deliver \[attribute, e.g., responses in \<Xms\] for \[Y%\] of queries, scale to \[Z users\] with \[uptime %\], and meet \[security standard, e.g., GDPR\]. Peak load: \[volume\].

## 8.2 AI-Specific Requirements (LLMs)

**Purpose**: Ensure the AI consistently delivers accurate, reliable, ethical, and user-aligned outputs.

**Key Questions**:

* What are the key AI architectural choices?  
* What accuracy, reliability, and ethical standards must our AI meet?  
* How will we measure these qualities?  
* How will we maintain them over time?

**Example**:

AI must achieve \[X% accuracy\] on \[test set\], limit \[issue, e.g., hallucination\] to \[\<Y%\], and meet \[standard, e.g., ethical guidelines\] via \[method, e.g., RAG\]. Measured by \[metric, e.g., F1 Score\], validated \[frequency, e.g., monthly\].

# 9\. Go-to-Market Approach

**Purpose**: Define how you rapidly demonstrate measurable value and grow user adoption.

**Key Questions**:

* What are the build and release phases (e.g., an MVP addressed to early adopters)?  
* What are the first market segment(s) we want to focus on?  
* How can we win those customers, rapidly demonstrate the value, and get evidence to accelerate further growth?

**Example**:

* Phase 1: Launch an MVP targeting \[segment\] in \[region\], offering \[value, e.g., X% savings\] within \[timeframe\]. Success: \[metric, e.g., Y% activation rate\] and \[evidence, e.g., Z case studies\] in \[timeframe\].   
* Phase 2: \[expansion plan\].
